Team members: Bingqian Wu, Daniel Lee, Lulu dong, Suzy Gao, Tushar Vijay Ponkshe

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the emotion classification accuracy for images of people to 47%.

[Contribution Statement] As a group, we chose which models to implement for the project. AB and CD developed baseline classification model for evaluation. EF and GH explored feature engineering for improving the baseline model. AB, EF and GH discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. CD carried out the computation for model evaluation. 

Bingqian worked on building CNN model and tuning it.
